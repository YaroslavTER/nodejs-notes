  cluster

    the module can be used to enable load balancing over
    environment multiple CPU cores

    knows how to imp lement clone scalability strategy
    but only on one machine

    master process forks number of processes and manages
    them

                      worker1

    master process    worker2

                      worker3

    each worker represents the instance of the application
    that you want to scale

    all incoming requests are handled by master process and
    the master process is the one who desides which worker
    process should handle the incoming requests

    the master process uses Round-robing algoritm to pick
    the process. It's enabled by default on all platforms
    except Windows and can be globally modified to let the
    load balancing be handled by the operating system itself

    the Round-robin algoritm distributes the load evenly
    across all available processes on the rotational bases.
    The first request is forwarded to the first worker
    process, the second to the next one and so on. And when
    the end of the list is reached the algorithm starts
    again from the beginning. This is the simplest load
    balancing algorithm but not the only one

    availability

      to measure availability you can run the following
      command in the console

      `ab -c200 -t10 http://localhost:8080/`

    shared state

      original

                                    worker1 -> memory1 

        request -> master process   worker2 -> memory2

                                    worker3 -> memory3

      shared memory

                                    worker1 --
                                              |
        request -> master process   worker2 -- -> memory
                                              |
                                    worker3 --

      master process memory container

                                                  worker1 -> memory1 

        request -> master process -> memory ->    worker2 -> memory2

                                                  worker3 -> memory3

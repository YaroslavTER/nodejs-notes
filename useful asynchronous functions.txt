useful asynchronous functions

    every time the event loop takes a full trop, it calls a tick

    process.nextTick

        invokes at the end of the current operation, before the next event loop tick starts

    setTimeout

        invokes after it passes the event loop

    setImmediate
    
        invokes on the next tick of the event loop

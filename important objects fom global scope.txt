important objects from the global scope:
    
    process

        is an event evmmiter

        .on()
            
            exit
            
                can do only syncronous operations inside this event handler

            uncaughtException

                for uncaught exceptions handling

                use `process.exit(1)` inside this event handler

    Buffer

        uses to work with binary streams of data. Is a chunk of a memory, allocated outside the v8 heap.
        can not be resized once it allocated

        it useful when you have to read thinks like an image file from tcp stream or compressed file.
        Or any othe form of binary access

        memory allocation

            .alloc()

                creates a filled buffer of certain size

            .allocUnsafe()

                will not fill the created buffer and have to be filled by `.fill()`.
                It has cleare performance advantages

            .from()

        .slice()

            sliced buffer shares the same memory with the original buffer


        when converting streams of binary data we should use the String Decoder module. In general,
        if you receiving utf-8 bites as chunks in a stream you should always use string decoder

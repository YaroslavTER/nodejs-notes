    is the HTTP protocol over TLS SSL

    node has specific module to work with HTTPS called `https`

    createServer()

        to create the server you have to specify object with properties `key` and `cert` (certificate).
        You can also pass `pfx` option to combine `key` and `cert`.

            params object
    
                you have to load files to assign the `key`, `cert` properties using `fs.readFileSycn()` method and pass as the params
                relative filepath to the `.pem` file

        to generate certificate you can use OpenSSL tool

            OpenSSL allows to generate a private key, we can have it encrypted or not encrypted and it allows to generate a certificate
            signing request and then self sign certificate to test it. The broser will not trust selfmade certificate, but it's good for
            testing purposes

            command for private key and certificate generation

                `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes`

    listen()

        server has 443 as a default port for HTTPS communication

    to execute the HTTPS script you have to run it as a root `sudo node https.js`

    after execution the script and visiting `https://localhost/` the broser will warn you about self made certificate
    but you can specify that you trust it to see the script result

export

    `exports` is a variable reference to the `module.exports` object

    you can use `exports` to export properties, but you can't reassign `exports` with the object

    `exports.id = 1` is valid

    `exports = { id: 1 }` is not valid, because if to change the whole `exports` variable, it won't longer be the reference to the `module.exports` object

    to be able to reassgin the `exports` with the object, you have to use `module.exports`

    by default, variables defined in the scope of the file, won't be available outside the module.
    Only the thinks that are exported are available
